Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction

**Inspiration:
**

"Agriculture is a fundamental source of National Prosperity."

The agriculture is not a simple job it depend on many things and we unable to predict it.
The new era of the world refuse to give higher importance to the farming it lead to major issuse and then it will affect the future generation too.
This is the timw to help them by giving our support .
New Tech Era will help to give more solution to the problem faced by the farmer and it will help to increase the growth in the Agriculture.
For this,
 we took this project and we will try to give our support the "Service man who serve food to save our life."


**Project Description:**

Agriculture is the most important sector in today’s life. Most plants are affected by a wide variety of bacterial and fungal diseases. Diseases on plants placed a major constraint on the production and a major threat to food security. Hence, early and accurate identification of plant diseases is essential to ensure high quantity and best quality. In recent years, the number of diseases on plants and the degree of harm caused has increased due to the variation in pathogen varieties, changes in cultivation methods, and inadequate plant protection techniques. 

An automated system is introduced to identify different diseases on plants by checking the symptoms shown on the leaves of the plant. Deep learning techniques are used to identify the diseases and suggest the precautions that can be taken for those diseases. 

**Project Objectives**

By the end of this project you’ll understand:

Preprocess the images.

Applying the CNN algorithm to the dataset.

How deep neural networks detect the disease.

You will be able to know how to find the accuracy of the model.

You will be able to build web applications using the Flask framework.

**Project Flow**

A web Application is built  where 
Farmers can interact with the portal build
Interacts with the user interface to upload images of diseased leaf.

Our model built analyses the Disease and suggests the farmer with fertilizers are to be used 
To accomplish the above task you must complete the below activities and tasks 
Download the dataset.

Classify the dataset into train and test sets.

Add the neural network layers.

Load the trained images and fit the model. 

Test the model.

Save the model and its dependencies.

Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.
